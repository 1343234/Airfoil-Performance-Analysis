# Airfoil-Performance-Analysis


Outcome:
The Python script generates a visualisation of the airfoil's performance characteristics as a function of velocity.


Installation & Usage
This project is provided as a standalone executable file for Windows, so no installation of Python or any libraries is required.

Download the naca_2412_airfoil_performance.exe file from this GitHub repository.

Run the application by double-clicking the .exe file.

Command-line window will appear, and the script will execute. The final --.png plot will be saved in the same folder where the executable was ran.
